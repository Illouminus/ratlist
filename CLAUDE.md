# Крысиные желания / Rat List — agent handoff

A wishlist + Secret Santa app — started as a private tool for one
friend group, now publicly deployed on **`ratlist.app`**. Phase 1A
(production deploy, legal, email, account self-mgmt, SEO) and Phase
1B (OAuth Google, PWA + service worker, dynamic OG image, focus
traps, Plausible, uptime) shipped 2026-05-17. v0.2 is feature-complete:
groups, items, public share URLs, Secret Santa, realtime, priority
levels, an editorial landing page, account self-management,
GDPR-compatible legal pages. **Events as a first-class entity** shipped
the same evening (M2 redesign) — see EVENTS_M2.md.

| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend    | Vite + React 19 + TypeScript (strict)              |
| Styling     | Vanilla CSS, design tokens via CSS variables       |

| Hosting     | Vercel (frontend) + Supabase Pro project (Frankfurt) |

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. Local Supabase (running on shifted ports 544xx to coexist with
#    another instance the user has on the default 543xx).
supabase start

# 2. App
cd app
cp .env.example .env.local    # (already filled in this repo)
npm install                   # first time
npm run dev                   # http://localhost:5173

# 3. Edge function (URL meta fetcher) — separate process
supabase functions serve --no-verify-jwt
```

Useful URLs:
- App: http://localhost:5173
- Supabase Studio: http://localhost:54423
- Mailpit (catches auth emails): http://localhost:54424
- DB direct: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54422/postgres`

## Testing

- Frontend unit + RTL: `cd app && npm test`
- Integration (RLS + Santa draw): `eval "$(supabase status --output env | sed 's/^/export /')"; cd supabase/tests/integration && npm test`
- Edge function Deno tests: `cd app && npm run test:edge`
- All of the above run in CI on every PR. See `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Hard conventions (do not break)

### TypeScript

`tsconfig.app.json` has `strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`,
`noImplicitReturns`, etc. **Never widen with `any`.** Use `unknown` for
truly-unknown values and narrow.

### React + hooks

`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` is enforced. Pattern across every
hook (`useMyItems`, `useGroups`, `useSantaEvent`, …):

- A pure free async fetcher returns the next `FetchState`
- `useEffect` calls it and `setState` happens inside `.then(...)` — so
  state updates always sit after a yield, never synchronously inside
  the effect body

Don't break this pattern when adding new hooks. If lint complains about
setState-in-effect, you wrote it wrong.

### Errors

Every Supabase error (PostgrestError / AuthError / FunctionsError /
string) flows through `app/src/lib/errors.ts`. Add new failure modes by
matching SQLSTATE or RAISE EXCEPTION text in `errorCode()` and adding a
string under `errors.*` in both `ru.ts` and `en.ts`. UI uses
`setError(errorMessage(t, result.error))` — never `setError(result.error)`.

### i18n

`src/i18n/ru.ts` is the source of truth. `src/i18n/en.ts` must conform
to the same `Translation` shape (recursive — nesting allowed, e.g.
`errors.titleTooLong`). Newlines in strings render as line breaks when
the element has `whiteSpace: 'pre-line'`.

Keys are dot-paths: `t('list.headlineMine', { count: 3 })`. The `t()`
function falls back to RU then to the raw key with a dev-mode warning.

### CSS / design

Tokens in `src/styles/tokens.css`. Use CSS variables, **not** hardcoded
sizes. The responsive ones to know:

- `--page-pad-y`, `--page-pad-x` — clamp-based page padding
- `--display-xl/l/m/s/xs` — clamp-based heading sizes (28→48, 24→40,
  etc.)
- `--bp-tablet: 768px` — single breakpoint. CSS media queries match.

Editorial vibe: paper background, ink text, terracotta accent, hairlines
instead of cards, Newsreader italic for display, Public Sans for body,
Caveat for marginalia. Stick to it.

### Privacy invariants (DO NOT regress)

These are enforced at the DB via RLS — not the client. Tested via
psql/REST during development. **If you touch the schema or any of these
tables, re-verify after.**

1. `claims` rows are **invisible to the owner** of the item.
   Item-owners viewing their own list never see who claimed what.
2. `santa_assignments` rows are visible only to the giver until the
   event status flips to `revealed`. Even the organiser is blind unless
   they themselves joined as a participant.
3. `items` are visible to the owner OR to members of any group the
   item is published to (`item_groups` junction).

The draw runs in a `SECURITY DEFINER` Postgres function
(`run_santa_draw`); clients never INSERT into `santa_assignments`.

### Testing & deploy discipline (lessons from 2026-05-25 smoke)

The link-first redesign passed CI green on every PR yet shipped four
visible bugs to prod. Each one teaches a rule worth following:

1. **Migrations and code ship together — atomically.** Vercel
   auto-deploys the frontend on merge to `main`; the
   `Deploy migrations to prod` workflow
   ([docs/DEPLOY_MIGRATIONS_SETUP.md](docs/DEPLOY_MIGRATIONS_SETUP.md))
   does the same for schema. Don't merge a PR that contains both
   migrations + frontend code unless the migrations workflow secrets
   are in place, otherwise prod serves code expecting columns that
   don't exist yet (the `share_token = undefined` bug).

2. **Auto-generated types lie when prod schema diverges.**
   `app/src/types/database.ts` reflects the LOCAL schema. If a PR
   merges with the matching migration but the migration hasn't reached
   prod, prod data won't have the columns the types promise. Defensive
   UI for newly-added nullable-but-typed-non-null fields:
   render a loader or hide the block when the value is falsy. Don't
   trust `${event.share_token}` to be defined just because TS says so.

3. **Cross-component flows need integration tests OR an explicit
   manual smoke checklist in the PR description.** Unit tests pass
   each component in isolation. The `?next=` round-trip
   (EventLandingScreen → LoginScreen → AuthProvider → AuthCallbackScreen
   → back to landing) had a passing test on every component and was
   still completely broken — because each test mocked the consumer
   away. Either:
   - Mount the full chain in one vitest test that exercises every hop,
   - Or list manual steps in the PR ("open `/event/<token>` in
     incognito → sign in → expect redirect to `/event/<token>` →
     expect row in `event_participants`") and walk through them.

4. **Assertions exact, not "at least one".** Use `toHaveLength(N)`,
   not `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(N)`. Use `toBeNull()` not
   `toBeFalsy()`. The post-create share card duplicated the share URL
   for weeks because the test asserted "URL appears ≥ 1 time" — it
   was 2, the test passed. A `toHaveLength(1)` would have caught it
   the moment CoordinatorPanel landed.

5. **Smoke before claiming "shipped".** Tests passing ≠ feature
   working. After CI is green AND the deploy lands, open the actual
   user flow in incognito and walk through it ONCE. If you can't do
   it, say so in the PR description so the human knows to smoke
   themselves. "All green, ready to merge" is not a substitute for
   "I clicked the button and it worked."

These aren't aspirational — they're the price of the four prod bugs
fixed in PR #13. Re-read this section before claiming completion on
anything that touches schema, auth, or multi-component flows.

### Components inventory

Visual atoms (`app/src/components/`):
- `PaperLayout` — page padding + max-width column. Used by every screen.
- `AppLayout` — chrome (sidebar on desktop, mobile top + bottom tab bar
  on mobile). Wraps authed routes via `Router.appRoute()`.
- `Sidebar` / `BottomTabBar` / `MobileTopBar` — the chrome pieces
- `Button` — primary / dark / ghost variants
- `Field` — label + input wrapper
- `SketchInput` — text input with underline only
- `LangToggle` — RU/EN switcher
- `ItemPhoto` — `<img>` if cover_url, else `PhotoPlaceholder`
- `PhotoPlaceholder` — watercolour fallback
- `OccasionTag` — dot + uppercase label
- `PriorityDots` — •/••/••• priority marker
- `EndOfList` — "that's the lot — for now." marker with tail doodle
- `Toast` + `useToast()` — transient bottom-of-viewport notice
- `ConfirmDialog` + `useConfirm()` — promise-based modal confirm
  (replaces window.confirm everywhere)
- `ShareDialog` — controls the public share token (`/share/<token>`)
- `ReportDialog` — reusable flag-for-moderation modal (share / profile / item / group);
  anon-friendly, inserts into `public.reports`
- `rats/` — five SVG illustrations (Sitting, Running, Peeking, Tail,
  RatDefs filter)

### Screens

Public (no auth):
- `/` for anonymous → `LandingScreen` (editorial marketing page)
- `/login`, `/auth/callback`, `/invite/:token` — auth flow
- `/share/:token` → `PublicListScreen` (view-only, anon allowed)
- `/onboarding` — authed but pre-onboarding

Authed (full chrome via `appRoute`):
- `/` for authed → `MyListScreen` (items grid/list)
- `/add` → `AddItemScreen` (full-screen create form)
- `/i/:itemId` → `ItemDetailScreen` (works for own + friend's items)
- `/i/:itemId/edit` → `EditItemScreen` (full-screen edit form)
- `/events` → `EventsScreen` (events I see — own + audience)
- `/events/new` → `CreateEventScreen` (full-screen create form)
- `/events/:eventId` → `EventDetailScreen` (honoree edit / guest claim)
- `/groups` → `GroupsScreen` (circles + members + invites — reachable
  from Settings, no longer a primary nav tab)
- `/people` → `PeopleScreen` (directory with preview titles + event counts)
- `/p/:userId` → `FriendListScreen` (friend's events + items + claim/release)
- `/santa` → `SantaListScreen` (events)
- `/santa/:eventId` → `SantaEventScreen` (participants, exclusions,
  draw, reveal)

Primary nav is **4 tabs**: My list / Events / People / Santa (plus the
central FAB → `/add`). Circles live one settings-click away — they're
long-lived infrastructure (audience definitions), not a daily destination.

All authed routes are lazy-loaded via `React.lazy` — see
`Router.lazyNamed()`. Landing + auth screens are eager (critical path).

| **Transactional email: Santa start (group invite)**      | ✅ Phase 1C done — `send-santa-start` fires on event creation |
| **Transactional email: group invite by email**           | ✅ Phase 1C done — `send-group-invite` + "send by email" in `<InviteList>` |
| Transactional email: Santa reveal / account deletion     | ⬜ ~30 min, copy-paste from `send-santa-draw` |

| **Events as first-class entity** (M2 redesign)           | ✅ done — `events` / `event_circles` / `event_items` tables, honoree-managed curation, audience via circles, primary nav surfaces it as a tab |
| **Events link-first redesign** (M3 — replaces M2 audience model) | ✅ shipped 2026-05-25 — PRs #9–#12 (data + email + public UI + coordinator UI), #13–#18 (polish + auth round-trip fixes). `event_participants` table + `events.share_token` + 5 RPCs, public `/event/<token>` landing, auto-join after sign-in, coordinator panel with InviteFromPeopleModal, sectioned EventsScreen, magic-link + Google OAuth both confirmed working end-to-end on prod. See `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/project_events_link_first.md` for the full narrative. |
| **Realtime debounce** (`useEvents` postgres_changes burst → 1 RPC) | ✅ Bucket 3 done — `app/src/lib/debounce.ts` (300 ms trailing) wired into the realtime effect |
| **Skip-link to `#main` (a11y)**                          | ✅ Bucket 3 done — `<SkipLink>` mounted in `App.tsx`, `id="main" tabIndex={-1}` on `<main>` in `AppLayout` + conditional in `PaperLayout` |
| **Priority drag-and-drop between sections**              | ✅ shipped 2026-05-26 — PRs #23 (initial) + #24 (mobile row-as-activator) + #25 (MouseSensor swap to fix scroll-hijack on touch). MyList / friend / share / event detail lists are sectioned by priority (•••/••/•); MyList rows are draggable between sections via `@dnd-kit/core + sortable`; spec + plan in `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-05-26-priority-dnd-sections*.md`. **Canon for the sensor stack: MouseSensor + TouchSensor + KeyboardSensor — never PointerSensor with `distance` on a sortable list, it hijacks scroll on touch.** Migration `20260526000000_public_item_priority.sql` added priority to `public_item` composite + `get_public_list` RPC. |
| **Notes visible in row preview + no more auto-fill**     | ✅ shipped 2026-05-26 — PR #26. Owner's note now renders inline (2-line clamp) on friend list / event detail / event landing in addition to the already-existing MyList + public-share rendering. The form auto-fill from URL meta description was dropped (friends want personal comments, not page blurbs). Migration `20260526200000_event_view_note.sql` adds `note` to the `get_event_view` RPC payload. |
| **Event detail redesign** (`/events/:id`)                | ✅ shipped 2026-05-26 — PR #27 + #28. Killed dead `AudienceSection` (M2 leftover after link-first events retired circles). Replaced heavy share-link block with inline mono-meta line under title («ссылка для гостей · скопировать ↗ · позвать друзей →»). Items adopt hero+tiles layout: first item per priority section = 200px editorial hero with untruncated note; rest = 1:1 tiles with 1-line note teaser. New `PhotoPlaceholder` `withRat`+`signText` props render a SittingRat with i18n'd «без фото» / «no photo» sign on opt-in surfaces. `useEvent` lost the dead `attachCircle`/`detachCircle`/`audience` surface; `useGroups` import + dead `events.audience*` / `addCircle` / `removeCircle` i18n keys all dropped. Spec + plan at `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-05-26-event-detail-redesign*.md`. |
| **Manual SW registration with error handling**           | ✅ shipped 2026-05-26 — PR #29. Replaces `vite-plugin-pwa`'s `injectRegister: 'inline'` (which emitted a bare `register()` call without `.catch()`) with `src/registerSW.ts` — manual register wrapped in try/catch that routes rejections to Sentry as `level: 'warning'` instead of unhandled-rejection email alerts. Triggered by a single prod hit from Chrome Mobile / Android 10 where `register()` rejected; we get visibility for trends without panic alerts on transient mobile failures. |

## Known gotchas

### Local Supabase ports

We run on **544xx** (54421 API / 54422 DB / 54423 Studio / 54424 Mailpit
/ 54427 Analytics / 54420 shadow). This is to coexist with the user's
other Supabase project that runs on default 543xx. **Don't `supabase
stop` the other instance** without authorisation — the user said
"наверное" which the classifier read as tentative.

### `verbatimModuleSyntax`

`tsconfig` has `verbatimModuleSyntax: true`. Type imports must use
`import type { ... }`. If you forget, tsc complains.

### React 19 + react-router 7 dedupe

`vite.config.ts` dedupes `react` and `react-dom` across deps. Without
this, react-router 7 pulled its own copy of React via Vite's
pre-bundler and broke hooks. **Don't remove the `dedupe` config.**

### `index.html` is the prerendered landing — NOT a generic SPA shell

This is non-obvious and has bitten production twice (Phase 1C and the
2026-05-25 SW debacle). Re-read before touching anything in the build
pipeline.

The build runs THREE collaborating plugins on `index.html`:

1. **`vite-prerender-plugin`** (`vite.config.ts`) — calls
   `src/prerender.tsx` once per route in `PRERENDER_ROUTES` (`/`,
   `/legal/privacy`, `/legal/terms`). For each route it
   `renderToString`s the React tree and **writes the result into the
   matching HTML file**. So after build:
   - `dist/index.html` = prerendered LandingScreen markup (~24 KB).
   - `dist/legal/privacy/index.html` = prerendered Privacy.
   - `dist/legal/terms/index.html` = prerendered Terms.
   - **None of these are an "empty SPA shell" anymore.**

2. **`writeSpaFallback`** (custom plugin in `vite.config.ts`) — runs
   BEFORE prerender mutates `index.html`. Snapshots the untouched
   template to `dist/_spa.html`. **This** is the empty-root SPA
   shell; every non-prerendered route relies on it.

3. **`VitePWA` workbox** — generates the Service Worker. Workbox's
   default `navigateFallback` is `index.html` — but for us that's
   the prerendered landing, NOT a shell. We override:
   `navigateFallback: '/_spa.html'`. **Never remove this override.**

4. **Vercel rewrites** (`vercel.json`) — same idea at the CDN layer:
   `/((?!assets/|legal/|share/|api/).*) → /_spa`. Anything not on
   disk falls back to `_spa.html`, not `index.html`.

**Why this is a footgun:** if you ever serve `index.html` to a
client whose route isn't `/`, React tries to hydrate the EventsScreen
(or whatever) tree against landing markup. Hydration mismatches in
React 19 production can leave the wrong HTML in the DOM and render
the correct tree alongside / underneath it — confirmed prod bug
2026-05-25 where users saw LandingScreen at the top of `/events`
with the real page scrollable below it.

**Defense in `main.tsx`:** hydrate only when `location.pathname` is
in a hard-coded `PRERENDERED_PATHS` whitelist. Anything else does
`replaceChildren()` + `createRoot`, so even a misconfigured SW / CDN /
proxy can't break the client. This is intentional belt-and-braces;
**do not "simplify" back to `hasChildNodes()`-based detection**.

If you add a new prerendered route, you need to:
- Add it to `PRERENDER_ROUTES` in `src/prerender.tsx`.
- Add it to `PRERENDERED_PATHS` in `src/main.tsx`.
- Optionally exempt it from the SW navigation handler in
  `vite.config.ts → workbox.navigateFallbackDenylist` if the route
  has its own prerendered HTML on disk (legal pages do this; the
  SW would otherwise replace them with the SPA shell on refresh).

### Amazon prices

`fetch-url-meta` extracts title + photo from Amazon via productTitle
span and `data-old-hires`. Prices are rendered client-side by Amazon
JS, so static fetch can't see them — documented in the function header.
A headless browser would solve this but isn't worth it for v0.1.

### Item title length

Items have a CHECK constraint `length(title) between 1 and 200`.
Long og:title from a fetched URL is truncated to 100 chars before
prefilling the form. See `MyListScreen` → `AUTOFILL_TITLE_LENGTH`.

### When you change a migration

- New: `supabase/migrations/<UTC timestamp>_*.sql`. Apply with
  `supabase migration up --local`. Then **regenerate types**:
  `supabase gen types typescript --local --schema public 2>/dev/null
  > app/src/types/database.ts`
- Existing applied migration: don't edit. Add a new one.

### Test users in the local DB

Three users exist in `auth.users` for psql/REST testing:
- `462ecd08-...` — krysa@example.com (display: "Мышка")
- `d94dc0e9-...` — test@example.com
- `aaaa1111-...` — third@example.com
Plus a "Тестовый круг" group with all three in it, and 2 items owned
by krysa.

## How to verify privacy invariants

The user cares about them. After any change to `claims`, `items`,
`santa_*`, or their RLS, re-run something like:

```sh
# Mint a JWT for a user (replace sub)
JWT=$(node -e "...")
# Owner viewing own items — claims must be []
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:54421/rest/v1/items?owner_id=eq.<owner-id>&select=id,claims(user_id)" \
  -H "apikey: $ANON" -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_OWNER"
# Non-owner viewing the same — claims must include the claim
curl ... -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_OTHER"
```

The first session's commit messages have full examples — search
`git log -p` for `psql` and `curl`.

## What the user values

(captured from feedback)
- Clean code, comments, modular, strict types — not hacky
- Russian UI, casual register
- Responsive matters; mobile is primary
- Don't leak DB errors to the UI (we now have the central mapper —
  use it)
- Don't break the editorial aesthetic — paper, ink, terracotta,
  hairlines, italic Newsreader, Caveat marginalia, rat doodles in
  margins
- The user explicitly de-prioritised deploy multiple times — "успеем
  задеплоить когда все сделаем локально". Don't lead with deploy in
  recommendations; finish the product first
- Latest direction (2026-05): product is being positioned for public
  launch with eventual affiliate monetization. The deployment +
  marketing work lives in [PUBLIC_LAUNCH.md](PUBLIC_LAUNCH.md), to be
  picked up in a future dedicated session

## Commit conventions

Conventional commits style: `feat(area):`, `fix(area):`, `refactor(area):`,
`chore:`. The user wants atomic commits per logical change. **Always**
end commit messages with:

```
Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

Use the heredoc form for git commit -m to preserve formatting.

## Skill triggering — calibrated for this project

The superpowers skill set (`brainstorming`, `writing-plans`,
`executing-plans`, `test-driven-development`, etc.) is powerful but
expensive: each invocation burns context and produces artifacts
(spec/plan files under `docs/superpowers/`) that nobody re-reads
afterward. The default `using-superpowers` trigger ("if there's a 1%
chance a skill might apply, invoke it") over-fires for the kind of
small polish PRs that dominate steady-state work on this project.

**Skip heavy skills unless the threshold below is met.** When unsure,
propose the diff first and ask "should I have done a plan instead?"
— corrections are cheap, ceremony is not.

### Skip by default — invoke only when the listed condition is met

- **brainstorming** — only when (a) the goal can't be described in
  2 sentences AND there's real ambiguity about approach, OR (b) you
  can name >1 plausible design with concrete tradeoffs to discuss.
  "Make X look like Y", "add Z field", "fix the bug where …" → just
  propose a diff.
- **writing-plans + executing-plans + subagent-driven-development**
  — only for work that touches >4 files OR will span >1 day OR
  needs review checkpoints between pieces. The paper trail under
  `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/` was worth it for multi-PR
  refactors (buckets 1–3, link-first events). Single-PR polish is
  *not* "non-trivial enough".
- **test-driven-development** — skip for CSS / layout / copy. Tests
  can't meaningfully cover visual changes. Use for new RPCs, hooks
  with behavior, RLS rules, Edge Function logic.
- **dispatching-parallel-agents** — only when there are genuinely
  independent tasks. Don't dispatch a single agent for a single
  thing — call the tools directly.

### Always on (cheap and have caught real prod bugs)

- **verification-before-completion** — yes, every time. Same idea
  as the "smoke before claiming shipped" rule in the testing
  discipline section above.
- **systematic-debugging** — yes, whenever a bug isn't immediately
  obvious. Cheaper than blind trial-and-error.
- **receiving-code-review** — yes, when ingesting review feedback.
  Prevents performative agreement.

### Calibration from recent PRs

| PR | Verdict | Why |
|----|---------|-----|
| #23/24/25 (priority DnD) | non-trivial — plan justified | new dnd-kit wiring + migration + sensor iteration, 3 PRs |
| #26 (notes everywhere) | borderline — spec ok, plan overkill | 4 surfaces but the design was settled |
| #27/28 (event detail redesign) | trivial — the ceremony was a mistake | clear direction, 1 PR; full ritual burned a 1M session on a result the user disliked |
| #29 (manual SW reg) | clearly trivial | one file, ~20 LOC, no design discussion needed |

### Reading order for context

When you start a session: auto-loaded memory in `MEMORY.md`, then
this file, then `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Don't re-derive context already
captured there.
